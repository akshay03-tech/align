She had some sweets that she wouldn't share. She had a book that she wouldn bland. She wouldn't let anyone play with her dog. She's nobody's friend. He had some toffee. N a devery bed. Tricycle hi woodland. Never let anyone play with his train. Is nobody's friend. Share all of my sweet with you. My ball in my books and my games i will land. You have my apple and have my cake.
